    Problem
    You have several tasks and need to respond to just one of them completing. The most
    common situation for this is when you have multiple independent attempts at an op‚Äê
    eration, with a first-one-takes-all kind of structure. For example, you could request stock
    quotes from multiple web services simultaneously, but you only care about the first one
    that responds.
